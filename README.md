# Obsidian ðŸ«¶ Longform ðŸ«¶ Pandoc

Longform is a writing plugin for Obsidian. One of the features is that it allows you to compile your writing project, taking it through a series of steps to produce a final document. This may be things like stripping out internal links, or removing comments. But often we can take things a step further...

This script will add a brand new User Compile Step that will give you the ability to export your writing project as a .docx or a .epub file, with all the configuration necessary to set it up correctly.

Add these files wherever you've chosen to store your Longform Compile Step Scripts, and if your Longform Settings recognises the script, you'll be good to go.

P.S. Don't forget to install `pandoc`, and then paste in pandoc's path location into the compile step. [Download and Install Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc).
